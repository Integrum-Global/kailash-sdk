"""Unit tests for AsyncSQLDatabaseNode event loop isolation feature.

This test file implements Tier 1 (Unit) tests for the event loop isolation fix.
Tests are written FIRST following TDD methodology (RED phase).

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: Tests should FAIL initially until implementation is complete.

Test Coverage:
- Pool key generation with event loop ID
- Pool validation across event loops
- Cleanup of pools from closed event loops

- ADR: sdk-contributors/project/adrs/0071-async-sql-event-loop-isolation.md
