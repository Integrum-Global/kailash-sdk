"""Node-specific test fixtures and configuration."""

# Import common fixtures from parent conftest
# The main conftest.py already provides:
# - event_loop (session-scoped)
# - PostgreSQL checking and markers
# - All common node fixtures

# This file is kept for potential future node-specific fixtures
# All common fixtures have been moved to the main conftest.py
